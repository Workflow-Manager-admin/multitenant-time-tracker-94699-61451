# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Multitenant Time Tracker Web Application

---

### 1. Overview

The Multitenant Time Tracker is a web application that allows users to record, manage, and review time spent on projects for various clients. Tailored for freelancers, agencies, and development teams, the app enables tracking time on project work sessions, the technologies used, metadata for context, and robust management of projects and clients. Designed with a minimalist, modern, and clean UI, the product is accessible and fast across all devices, including mobile.

Supporting multiple tenants, the solution allows clear segmentation of data for different companies or user groups while enabling administrators and users to work in isolated workspaces.

### 1.1. Step-by-Step Development Plan

> **Development Plan Integration**
>
> The following is the actionable, step-by-step development plan for building the Multitenant Time Tracker application. This plan is to be used by all members of the team as the single source of truth for implementation, coordination, and progress tracking.
>
> **For reference alongside PRD features, user stories, and QA:**

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Multi-Tenancy Setup
- Design and verify the multi-tenant data model, ensuring every business entity is tenant-isolated.
- Set up baseline PostgreSQL schema per [database-schema.md].
- Scaffold the FastAPI backend with initial structure and connection to the multitenant database.
- Implement tenant registration, organization creation, and basic admin user creation.
- Establish and document the authentication and tenant context enforcement for all backend APIs.

#### Phase 2: User Authentication & Core CRUD APIs
- Implement user login/logout, signup, and secure password management (for tenant users).
- Enforce tenant context for user session/token throughout all backend calls.
- Build CRUD endpoints for clients, projects, and technologies (with full tenant data separation).
- Basic seed/test data population for end-to-end validation.

#### Phase 3: Frontend Scaffolding & User Flows
- Scaffold out the React frontend: sidebar navigation, dashboard, and modal dialogs.
- Integrate user signup/login, tenant switching, and secure session handling.
- Build the main dashboard view, wiring up core project/client lists and summaries.
- Connect basic start/stop timer and manual time entry to backend endpoints for foundational work session tracking.

#### Phase 4: Business Logic and Feature Completion
- Implement robust work session timer (prevent overlap, track precise times).
- Enable adding/editing clients, projects, assigning technologies/tags.
- Provide real-time dashboard widgets: project/client/technology summaries.
- Full-feature filterable, exportable reporting (CSV/Excel) with all reports tenant-scoped.
- Implement backend and frontend unit/integration tests.

#### Phase 5: UX Polish, Security, and Mobile Responsiveness
- Polish the frontend for accessibility, theme/contrast, and handoff for all responsive breakpoints.
- Harden backend for security: CORS, JWT expiry/refresh, error handling, and data validation.
- Document all endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger) and core architecture.
- Validate strict tenant isolation through QA test cases and simulated attack scenarios.

#### Phase 6: Quality Assurance & Release Preparation
- Run comprehensive QA cycle based on defined user stories and QA checklists.
- Address bugs, edge cases, and performance bottlenecks.
- Prepare deployment artifacts, .env setup, and documentation for each container.
- Final stakeholder walkthrough and acceptance.

### 2. Target Users

- **Freelancers**: Track billable project time per client and technology, export reports for invoicing.
- **Agencies**: Manage multiple clients and teams, view consolidated time data, and oversee project progress.
- **Development Teams**: Collaborate within organizations, assign and track various project activities, and analyze team output.

---

### 3. Platforms

- **Frontend**: Modern web application (React).
- **Backend API**: FastAPI Python backend serving RESTful endpoints.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing users, projects, clients, technologies, and time entries.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: All layers support true multi-tenant data isolation.

---

### 4. Features

- **User Authentication & Multi-Tenant Login**
  - Secure signup, login, and session management.
  - Tenant-aware access control so users can only interact with their own organizationâ€™s data.

- **Dashboard View**
  - Summarized visualization of time tracked by project, by client, by date, and by technology.
  - Quick-glance charts, lists, and summaries for recent activity.

- **Start/Stop Timers for Work Sessions**
  - Users can start a timer for a new work session on any active project.
  - Manual time entry and editing allowed to accommodate missed sessions.

- **Assign Technologies to Projects and Sessions**
  - Projects and sessions can be tagged with one or more technologies (e.g., React, Python, PostgreSQL).
  - Reporting by technology for skills/billing breakdown.

- **Add/Edit Clients and Projects**
  - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support for managing clients and projects.
  - Each entity is tenant-specific.

- **Minimalist Reporting and Export**
  - Filterable and exportable reports (CSV/Excel) for hours by user, project, client, or technology.
  - At-a-glance reporting widgets integrated in the dashboard.

- **Responsive, Mobile-friendly UI**
  - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
  - Minimalist, clean, modern styling; auto-theme (light/dark) with accessible contrast.

---

### 5. Use Cases

**UC1: Log Into Personal or Organization Dashboard**
- User selects or joins a tenant and logs in.
- Presented with an overview of their recent time-tracking activities and projects.

**UC2: Track Time for a Project**
- User starts a timer from the dashboard or project detail view.
- User can stop/pause the timer at any point; the session is recorded.

**UC3: Add/Edit a Project or Client**
- User creates or edits new projects and clients from a simple management interface.

**UC4: Assign Technology Tags**
- When creating a project or logging a session, user assigns relevant technology tags for deeper future analysis.

**UC5: Generate and Export a Report**
- User runs a report by client, project, or technology for any date range.
- Export functionality supports CSV and/or Excel formats for external billing or tracking.

**UC6: Mobile Usage**
- User opens the application on a mobile device and accesses all required features, including timing and data export, without loss of functionality.

### 6. High-Level Product Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Users can sign up, log in, and switch easily between tenants (organizations).
- Only the user's own organization's data is shown in all app views.
- Projects, clients, work sessions, and technology tags can be created, edited, and deleted, all scoped to the current tenant.
- Work session timers are precise, reliable, and prevent overlaps.
- Reporting is fast, filterable, and exportable.
- UI automatically adapts to screen size and device type.
- Application enforces secure authentication and authorization at all levels.

#### Technical Requirements
- React frontend with clean, minimalist component styling and accessibility support.
- FastAPI backend REST API supporting all major CRUD and report actions.
- PostgreSQL database schema specifically designed for multi-tenancy, with tenant ID columns and appropriate constraints.
- All code and API interfaces are structured for ease of future extension (e.g., more report types, additional integrations).

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast performance, even with large data sets.
- Secure handling of tenant data; strict isolation between organizations.
- Consistent, modern, minimalist design language with responsive layouts.
- Clean separation of frontend, backend, and data layers for maintainability.
- Minimal dependencies; preference for lightweight libraries.

---

### 7. Design Philosophy

- **Minimalistic, Modern, and Clean:** All interfaces prioritize whitespace, legibility, and intuitive grouping of information.
- **Accessibility-First:** High color contrast, keyboard accessibility, and clear interactive elements.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** All core actions and data must be easily usable on any screen size.

---

### 8. Out of Scope

- Advanced invoicing and billing modules.
- Third-party integrations (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack) in phase one.
- Custom branding per tenant (except for minimal color changes).

---

### 9. Success Criteria

- Users can track time and review reports accurately for any client/project/technology per tenant.
- Mobile and desktop experiences both provide complete access to critical workflows.
- No data leakage between tenants; rigorous tenant isolation.
- App remains fast and visually consistent at all times.
