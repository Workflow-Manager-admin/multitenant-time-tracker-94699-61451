# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Multitenant Time Tracker Web Application

---

### 1. Overview

The Multitenant Time Tracker is a web application that allows users to record, manage, and review time spent on projects for various clients. Tailored for freelancers, agencies, and development teams, the app enables tracking time on project work sessions, the technologies used, metadata for context, and robust management of projects and clients. Designed with a minimalist, modern, and clean UI, the product is accessible and fast across all devices, including mobile.

Supporting multiple tenants, the solution allows clear segmentation of data for different companies or user groups while enabling administrators and users to work in isolated workspaces.

---

### 3. Platforms

- **Frontend**: Modern web application (React).
- **Backend API**: FastAPI Python backend serving RESTful endpoints.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing users, projects, clients, technologies, and time entries.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: All layers support true multi-tenant data isolation.

---

### 4. Features

- **User Authentication & Multi-Tenant Login**
  - Secure signup, login, and session management.
  - Tenant-aware access control so users can only interact with their own organizationâ€™s data.

- **Dashboard View**
  - Summarized visualization of time tracked by project, by client, by date, and by technology.
  - Quick-glance charts, lists, and summaries for recent activity.

- **Start/Stop Timers for Work Sessions**
  - Users can start a timer for a new work session on any active project.
  - Manual time entry and editing allowed to accommodate missed sessions.

- **Assign Technologies to Projects and Sessions**

  - Reporting by technology for skills/billing breakdown.

- **Add/Edit Clients and Projects**
  - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support for managing clients and projects.
  - Each entity is tenant-specific.

- **Minimalist Reporting and Export**
  - Filterable and exportable reports (CSV/Excel) for hours by user, project, client, or technology.
  - At-a-glance reporting widgets integrated in the dashboard.

- **Responsive, Mobile-friendly UI**
  - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- User can stop/pause the timer at any point; the session is recorded.

**UC3: Add/Edit a Project or Client**
- User creates or edits new projects and clients from a simple management interface.

**UC4: Assign Technology Tags**

### 6. High-Level Product Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Users can sign up, log in, and switch easily between tenants (organizations).
- Only the user's own organization's data is shown in all app views.
- Projects, clients, work sessions, and technology tags can be created, edited, and deleted, all scoped to the current tenant.
- Work session timers are precise, reliable, and prevent overlaps.
- Reporting is fast, filterable, and exportable.
- UI automatically adapts to screen size and device type.
- Application enforces secure authentication and authorization at all levels.

#### Technical Requirements
- React frontend with clean, minimalist component styling and accessibility support.
- FastAPI backend REST API supporting all major CRUD and report actions.
- PostgreSQL database schema specifically designed for multi-tenancy, with tenant ID columns and appropriate constraints.
- All code and API interfaces are structured for ease of future extension (e.g., more report types, additional integrations).

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast performance, even with large data sets.
- Secure handling of tenant data; strict isolation between organizations.
- Consistent, modern, minimalist design language with responsive layouts.
- Clean separation of frontend, backend, and data layers for maintainability.
- Minimal dependencies; preference for lightweight libraries.

---

### 7. Design Philosophy

- **Minimalistic, Modern, and Clean:** All interfaces prioritize whitespace, legibility, and intuitive grouping of information.
- **Accessibility-First:** High color contrast, keyboard accessibility, and clear interactive elements.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** All core actions and data must be easily usable on any screen size.

---

### 8. Out of Scope

- Advanced invoicing and billing modules.
- Third-party integrations (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack) in phase one.
- Custom branding per tenant (except for minimal color changes).

---

### 9. Success Criteria

- Users can track time and review reports accurately for any client/project/technology per tenant.
- Mobile and desktop experiences both provide complete access to critical workflows.
- No data leakage between tenants; rigorous tenant isolation.
- App remains fast and visually consistent at all times.

---

### 10. Appendix

- **Technologies:**  
  - React (UI)  
  - FastAPI (API backend)  
  - PostgreSQL (Database Schema)
- **Frontend Design:**  
  - Sidebar navigation, dashboard content area, modal dialogs for editing/adding, top bar for quick actions.
